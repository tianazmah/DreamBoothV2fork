# Personalizing a Text-to-Image Diffusion Model on Moroccan Concepts or Style

This project is part of a hackathon organized by ThinkAI, with the goal of personalizing a text-to-image diffusion model on Moroccan concepts or style. The project aims to create a model that can generate images based on textual descriptions of Moroccan concepts or style.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes a collection of images of Moroccan concepts or style. The dataset was created from various online sources and was preprocessed before being used for training.

## Fine-tuning the model
We used the Dreambooth extension, a Google AI technique that allows for the training of a stable diffusion model using your own pictures.

## Problems we faced
We spent a lot of time working on an AI product for the third challenge, only to find out that GPT cannot be trusted for the information it gives due to a problem called hallucination. This caused us to be lost for the best part of the second day, trying to find something that would work. Finally, after many errors and many notebooks that would not work for mysterious reasons, we were able to train this model.

## Results
The trained model was able to generate images that closely resembled the given textual descriptions. However, it still faces some issues due to the dataset, which was barely enough to make the model understand what Amazigh jewelry is and create something similar. Nonetheless, we are proud of what we have achieved.

## ThinkAI
The hackathon was fun, amusing, and very stressful. It was the first time we participated in a hackathon, and we could not manage our time in the best way to be at our most productive level. We are not done, but the amount of information we consumed in these three days gave us an idea about AI. We are now very hungry for more information and experience. We thank 1337, UM6P, and MATH Maroc for giving us this opportunity.
